Foreign Minister S Jaishankar with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.98
New Delhi: In a sharp response to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent comments on a "rise in human rights abuses" in India, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar has said "people" are entitled to have views about India's policies but at the same time, New Delhi is "equally entitled" to have views about them.
The Foreign Minister, in his first official reaction to the US statements on Wednesday, also appeared to refer to the hate attack on two Sikh men in New York.</p>
